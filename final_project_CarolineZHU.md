**Summary**  
This project looks at women singers' representation in Grammy Musical Award over the years.  
For the past decades of years, women singers have less chance and representation in Grammy.Fortunately, the situation is getting better recently with a noticeable growth in 2019. However, the gender discrimination still exists in a lot of musical awards.  
   
To change this dilemma, to achieve a certain degree of gender equality in music awards and even the entire music industry, we need each of us to contribute our part.  
  
# **Project Structureüß¨**
**Topic**:   
Women singers‚Äô representation in Grammy over the years

**Reader perspective**:  
As a music lover or music industry worker, I want to see and work in a music industry where gender equality is not an exception but a rule so that every artist regardless of the gender can get equal opportunities.

**Call to action**:  
I can contribute to a music industry with gender equality by following more the works of female singers, MV directors and producers; and by standing up to support women singers‚Äô rights online when gender discrimination happens.

<p align = "center">

[Data Source: Growth of music sales on the day after the Grammy Awards in 2020, by type](https://www.statista.com/statistics/252744/growth-of-music-sales-following-the-grammay-awards/)    
Grammy awards drive the sales of songs and are one of the best ways to advertise artists‚Äô songs.
What happens to females artists is that they are overwhelmed in a vicious circle:   
1.They do not have money to advertize their songs.    
2.Their songs cannot be heard and noticed.     
3.Less or even no popuarity makes it hard to gain Grammys.      
4.No opportunities to reveal his song at the Grammys.      
5.Grammys are always gained by famous artists: success attracts success, while failure induces failure.      
üìç Story Telling Point: More women songs deserve hearing and noticing through Grammys.          
      
## ***Scenario 6Ô∏è‚É£*** 
**Call to action**   
1.	Get involved with organizations that support women in audio.  
2.	Listen to women-created and women-focused music podcasts.  
3.	Interact on social media.

Data referenced here are mainly of 3 types:    
1. Pictures:      
   Pictures of some artists will be used in the final project. Up until now, only the first women Grammy winner Ella Fitzgerald's photo is used here.
   However, more artists pictures may appear in the final project and each one's source will be well documented.    
2. Data:     
   Most of the data sources here are research articles, news, case studies in music industry and Grammy awards. Some sources are charts themselves, while non of the data visualization here immitates or simply copys the original charts. Only parts of the charts data are used and all the data sources here are publicly accessible.    
3. Idea:    
   When figuring out the major reasons for women's low representation in Grammys, some research articles' ideas are used and well documented under each data visualization.    
      
       
# **Method and mediumüíø**
The final deliverables will be an interactive stand-alone project created with Shorthand.  
Each senarios shown above will become 1 or 2 pages of the final Shorthand website. Actions and moves between different pages will be used to increase the interactivity and engagement with potential audience.  
For creating charts, Canva, Tableau and Flourish will be used.

   
   
# **Feedbacks from peersüë©üèª‚Äçüéìüßëüèª‚Äçüéì**
What worked:  
1. Good story lines and a lot of research with rich information.
2. Good color parttern choices and intuitive to tell the categories: pink for women and blue for men.     
3. Charts well related to the main topic.     
4. Good engagement with the audience.   
    
What didn't work and recommendations:   
1. In the scenario 3, the picture showing CMA awards gender distribution of winners over the years, it's showing only one genre of music, not representative enough of the whole situation. It's more like a case study.   
2. Understanding gap between sexual harassment and the women artists low representation. More explaination needed to connect those two and probably a more informative title can help.  
3. The ratio of gender distribution is not intuitive to look at: 17:109; Change it to 1:6.4 or 1:6, then it's more intuitive.   
4. Some ideas worth highlight to make them stand out: for example, for the sexual harassment part, "severly underreported" can be bolded to highlight.  
5. The alignment of some charts can be improved, for example, for the sexual harassment part, since two charts talk about the issue, the title can be put in the middle. Besides,the data label line should be put at the right position instead of in the middle of each small bar, otherwise the numbers there can be misleading and confusing like why 58% has shorter bar than 46% bar.    
6. For scenario 4 Reason 3, put the number outside of pie chart to make the ratio stand out.    
7. For scenario 5, adjust the arrow size so that it looks more reasonable for the comparison.   
8. General advice on presentation: too many charts here, may not present them all in one minute.
