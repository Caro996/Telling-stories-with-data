**Summary**  
This project looks at women singers' representation in Grammy Musical Award over the years.  
For the past decades of years, women singers have less chance and representation in Grammy.Fortunately, the situation is getting better recently with a noticeable growth in 2019. However, the gender discrimination still exists in a lot of musical awards.  
   
To change this dilemma, to achieve a certain degree of gender equality in music awards and even the entire music industry, we need each of us to contribute our part.

**Topic**:   
Women singers’ representation in Grammy over the years

**Reader perspective**:  
As a music lover or music industry worker, I want to see and work in a music industry where gender equality is not an exception but a rule so that every artist regardless of the gender can get equal opportunities.

**Call to action**:  
I can contribute to a music industry with gender equality by following more the works of female singers, MV directors and producers; and by standing up to support women singers’ rights online when gender discrimination happens.
