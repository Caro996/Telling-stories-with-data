**Comparison of 3 styles:**
1. Style 1 is a **simple bar chart** where each country's debt to GDP ratio represents a column. Even though it's **well sorted** and **easy to tell the top 1 country is Japan**, the **large number of columns** still make the chart **lenthy**; besides, the **country names** are laid out in a **inclined manner**, which makes it hard to tell which column belongs to which country.<br/> 
<br/> 
2. Style 2 is a **grid line chart** where each line represents each country's changes of debt to GDP ratio over the years. **Final year's data shown in dot** to emphasize the latest debt level. However, since **all countries's situation are shown**, it's still hard to compare one to the other.<br/> 
<br/> 
3. Style 3 is a **grid highlighted bar chart** where each column represents each year's average of continents' debt to GDP ratio. **Fewer categories** make it easier to compare ratios between continents and **highlighted column** emphasized the ratio of latest year. However, simplifying the chart and grouping by continents also sacrifice the detail of data, for example, we cannot tell that Japan has the highest debt to GDP ratio now.
